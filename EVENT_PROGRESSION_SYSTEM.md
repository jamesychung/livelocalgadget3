# Complete Event Progression System with Audit Trails

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive event progression system that provides venues and support teams with complete visibility into every event's lifecycle, including detailed audit trails with timestamps.

## System Architecture

### 1. Hybrid Status Management
- **Booking Status**: Primary status tracking for individual musician applications
- **Event Status**: Secondary status for overall event state
- **Event History**: Comprehensive audit trail for all changes

### 2. Data Models

#### Booking Model
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  status: "applied" | "communicating" | "confirmed" | "rejected" | "invited" | "pending" | "open" | "cancelled";
  event: Event;
  musician: Musician;
  venue: Venue;
  createdAt: DateTime;
  updatedAt: DateTime;
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### Event Model
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  status: "open" | "confirmed" | "cancelled" | "completed";
  title: string;
  date: DateTime;
  venue: Venue;
  createdAt: DateTime;
  updatedAt: DateTime;
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### EventHistory Model (NEW)
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  event: Event;
  booking?: Booking;
  changedBy: User;
  changeType: string;
  previousValue: string;
  newValue: string;
  description: string;
  context: JSON;
  metadata: JSON;
  createdAt: DateTime;
}
```

## Event Progression Workflow

### 1. Event Creation
```
Event Created â†’ Status: "open"
â†“
EventHistory Entry: "event_created"
```

### 2. Musician Applications
```
Musician Applies â†’ Booking Status: "applied"
â†“
EventHistory Entry: "booking_created"
```

### 3. Venue Actions
```
Venue Reviews Application
â”œâ”€â”€ Click "Communicate" â†’ Booking Status: "communicating"
â”œâ”€â”€ Click "Confirm" â†’ Booking Status: "confirmed"
â””â”€â”€ Click "Reject" â†’ Booking Status: "rejected"
â†“
EventHistory Entry: "booking_status" for each change
```

### 4. Event Updates
```
Venue Edits Event Details
â”œâ”€â”€ Title Change
â”œâ”€â”€ Date Change
â”œâ”€â”€ Description Change
â””â”€â”€ Ticket Price Change
â†“
EventHistory Entry: "event_[field]" for each change
```

## Audit Trail Features

### Automatic Logging
Every change automatically creates an EventHistory entry with:

- **Timestamp**: Exact date and time of change
- **User Attribution**: Who made the change
- **Change Type**: What type of change occurred
- **Previous/New Values**: Before and after values
- **Context**: Relevant IDs and metadata
- **IP Address**: For security tracking
- **User Agent**: Browser/client information

### Example Audit Trail Entry
```json
{
  "id": "history-123",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "changeType": "booking_status",
  "previousValue": "applied",
  "newValue": "communicating",
  "description": "Booking status changed from \"applied\" to \"communicating\"",
  "context": {
    "bookingId": "booking-456",
    "musicianId": "musician-789",
    "venueId": "venue-101",
    "eventId": "event-202",
    "changeReason": "venue_action"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "sessionId": "session-303",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1"
  },
  "changedBy": {
    "id": "user-404",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  }
}
```

## User Interface

### Event History Viewer
- **Timeline Display**: Chronological view of all changes
- **Search & Filter**: Find specific changes or filter by type
- **Status Transitions**: Visual display of status changes

## Conflict Prevention

### 1. Clear Separation of Concerns

- **No Overlap**: Each has distinct responsibilities

### 2. Automatic Logging
- **Every Change Logged**: No changes can occur without audit trail
- **Full Context**: Complete context preserved for each change
- **User Attribution**: Always know who made what change

### 3. Validation

- **User Permissions**: Proper access control
- **Data Integrity**: Consistent data across all models

## Research Capabilities

### For Venues
- **Complete Timeline**: See every action taken on their events
- **User Attribution**: Know who made each change
- **Search Functionality**: Find specific changes quickly

### Example Research Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Dispute Resolution
```
Venue: "The musician was never confirmed!"
Support: *checks EventHistory*
Result: "Booking status changed from 'applied' to 'rejected' on Jan 15 at 2:30 PM by John Doe"
```

#### Scenario 2: Timeline Verification
```
Venue: "When did we start communicating with the musician?"
Support: *filters EventHistory by "communicating"*
Result: "Booking status changed to 'communicating' on Jan 14 at 10:15 AM"
```

#### Scenario 3: User Activity Audit
```
Manager: "What changes did Jane make last week?"
Support: *filters EventHistory by user and date range*
Result: Complete list of all changes made by Jane in the specified period
```
